I recently purchased some foam dart blasters for my~~self~~ kids. They are as fun as I hoped they would be. I'll share more details on the experience, but I can highly recommend the following blasters:

- https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Racer
- https://dartzoneblasters.com/product/desperado/

And strongly warn against this piece of crap (at least all three that I bought were duds):
