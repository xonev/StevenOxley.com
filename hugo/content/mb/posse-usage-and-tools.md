I am a big fan of [Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (POSSE)](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), and I have been doing it for a while (this post is POSSEed, for example). Anyone else doing it? If so, what tools are you using? I've created a babashka script that currently meets my main requirements, but I'm looking for what other options are out there.
