I was listening to the [My First Million podcast](https://youtu.be/weGrqsbrMgE?si=fEmjI2G3e8frngFt&t=1709), and [Shaan Puri](https://www.shaanpuri.com/) shared a decision-making framework he uses to help him make better decisions (and record decisions for later analysis). I thought it could be useful to record decisions in this way, and I created a Google Form template based on his list of questions in case you want to try it, too: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xijYpldR9Ynzxvcz80S7wlV6vq44DZJGeL20Il03TEk/template/preview.
