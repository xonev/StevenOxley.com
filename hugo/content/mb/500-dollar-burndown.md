Tralina (my wife) and I give ourselves a "discretionary spending" budget that we can each spend however we want without consulting the other. I have taken $500 of my budget and put it in a bank account for my product launching side business project. It might be fun to track that investment money and see how it dwindles over time (or if I keep it in the black!). Current status: $466.79
