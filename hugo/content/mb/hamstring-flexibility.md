I've always had issues with hamstring and lower black flexibility. Even as a kid I couldn't touch my toes with my knees locked and performed poorly on that part of physical fitness tests. In my 30s it became a problem when I pulled both hamstrings one summer playing softball.

Since then, I've been better about regular stretching and flexibility exercises (I even got to where I could touch my toes with my knees locked once!) but I still have issues with injury now and then. For example, I did three cycling workouts last week, and yesterday I was literally just walking around and felt like my left hamstring was about to give out.

So I've decided today that I'm going to start taking this flexibility thing seriously. My new goal is to get to where I can put my palms fully on the ground with my legs together and knees locked. I'm not even sure what will work for me, but I'm going to start with daily stretching of some sort. The first two routines I'm trying are:

Wish me luck!
