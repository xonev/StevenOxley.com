I finished listening to the book [*Buy Then Build*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_Then_Build) this morning. I felt like the author was trying to make acquisition entrepreneurship sound easy while saying stuff like, You only need $100k down! and describing a process that sounds an awful lot like buying a house on steroids... and then you have a company that you have to run. Not for the faint of heart, but I admit I'm intrigued.
