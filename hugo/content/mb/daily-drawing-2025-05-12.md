I learned a cool tip about how to add details to foliage in this blog post from the art director of Bluey: [Creating Bluey: Tales from the Art Director - Chapter 1](https://substack.com/home/post/p-160039885?just_subscribed=true). It recommends organizing details around an orb. I decided that fir trees are more of a cone, so I tried to organize around a cone instead.
