Does your company have a traditional QA team? If so, what percentage of defects do you think they catch?

We don't have a QA team at Seeq. In chapter 1 of *Release It!* Michael Nygard talks about how some engineers develop code for the QA team to verify rather than for the customer to use or to work well in production. I think that I have been guilty of that - especially some of the work I did at Groupon comes to mind. At Seeq, the bigger temptation is to write software for the support team to manage and keep running.
