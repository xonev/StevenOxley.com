I set myself an audacious goal this year to try to launch product(s) that will make me $1M / year by the time I'm 40. That is not very far away at this point - 40 months from yesterday. I set the goal 4 months ago and I've launched.... nothing.

In order to accomplish the goal, I think I'll have to launch lots of products until something sticks... My original goal was to launch one every two months. But I've been too focused on success!

Today, I thought, "What if my goal was to fail instead..." and it was oddly freeing. That takes a lot of the pressure off of making things perfect... or even good for that matter. So maybe that will be my new goal - launch 20 failed products by the time I'm 40. And maybe I'll happen upon a success or two in there, as well.
