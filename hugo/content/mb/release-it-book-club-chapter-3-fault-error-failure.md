In Release It! chapter 3, Nygard makes distinctions between faults, errors, and failures:
- Fault: "A condition that creates an incorrect internal state in your software."
- Error: "Visibly incorrect behavior."
- Failure: "An unresponsive system."

"Triggering a fault opens the crack. Faults become errors, and errors provoke failures.. That's how the cracks propagate."

What do you think of these distinctions and this terminology for system failures?

In the past, I have used these terms interchangeably. I suppose I mostly refer to errors. It may be handy to have more precise terms to describe these stages of failure.
