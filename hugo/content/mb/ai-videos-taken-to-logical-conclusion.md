Is this the future?

"Siri, I'd like to watch a 10 episode, hour-per-episode show. Use the books I've been reading recently for inspiration (I especially like the sci-fi one you generated for me last week), but try to surprise me. Make sure not to end the 10 episodes on a cliffhanger, but leave it open for a future multi-episode installment if I feel like continuing."

Siri generates the first episode, my wife and I sit down to watch.
