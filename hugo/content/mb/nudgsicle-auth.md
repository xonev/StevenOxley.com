Nudgsicle is coming along - slowly but surely. It's amazing to me how much of a slog it is - even for someone like me who has integrated OAuth, OpenID Connect, etc. - to build authentication for an application. Even with services like Amazon Cognito.

Fun fact: did you know that ["Sign in with Slack"](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack) and ["Add to Slack"](https://api.slack.com/distribution#enabling) are two different things that shall not be combined?
