I decided to try out [dlvr.it](https://dlvr.it/) for syndicating the RSS feed from my microblog on my website to my social media accounts. There are two main things I'm interested in:

- how does it handle links?
- how does it handle threads?
- how does it handle HTML like this unordered list?

There doesn't appear to be any customization. And I think this microblog post should prove a good test. We will see how it goes!
