I finished reading Release It! by Michael Nygard recently. It was a great read - highly recommended - and triggered a number of thoughts which I explore in [Robust Software, Clear Thinking, and Production Excellence in Release It!](https://www.stevenoxley.com/blog/2025/08/26/robust-software-clear-thinking-and-production-excellence-in-release-it/).
