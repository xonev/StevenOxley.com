I'm starting an async book club for the book [Release It! Second Edition](https://pragprog.com/titles/mnee2/release-it-second-edition/) by [Michael T. Nygard](https://x.com/mtnygard) and you're invited to join! You can sign up here to register your interest and (hopefully) get a discount on the book: https://forms.gle/kti3xFYD7cMjEBYk9. Or go ahead and buy the book now (I already have mine). I plan to start reading and posting discussion questions at the beginning of February. I'm looking forward to it, and feel free to spread the word - all are welcome!
