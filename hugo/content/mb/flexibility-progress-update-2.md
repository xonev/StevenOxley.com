More [hamstring flexibility](https://www.stevenoxley.com/mb/hamstring-flexibility/) [progress](https://www.stevenoxley.com/mb/flexibility-progress-update/)! I've been able to touch my toes for weeks now, and last night I was able to touch the floor with my knees locked. I've never done that before ðŸ™€
