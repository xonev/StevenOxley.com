I’ve been trying to practice POSSE - Post On (your own) Site Syndicate Everywhere (LinkedIn, X, and Mastodon for now). I’ve been using Zapier and Buffer to do this, and it honestly kinda sucks and will be expensive when my 7 day Zapier trial ends…
I could probably make it work how I want since Zapier is quite flexible, but in order to access multi-step Zaps (which would be necessary), I'd have to spend $20 / month. Not worth it.
