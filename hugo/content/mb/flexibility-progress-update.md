The hamstring stretching routine [I’ve been doing](https://www.stevenoxley.com/mb/hamstring-flexibility/) is working! After only a couple days I saw major gains. Unfortunately, it seems like my hamstrings reset each day and I have to stretch them again to reflexify them. Also, I haven’t seen much absolute progress since the first couple days. I’ll keep at it!
