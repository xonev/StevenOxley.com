I love how Mastodon does link shortening using ellipses. LinkedIn is the worst - you can’t tell where you’re going until you click on it. And at least X gives you a choice not to shorten at all…
For example:
{{< figure src="/images/Screenshot%202024-10-16%20at%2011.35.36.png" title="Screenshot of mastodon ellipses" width=100% >}}
{{< figure src="/images/Screenshot%202024-10-16%20at%2012.10.32.png" title="LinkedIn screenshot with shortened URLs" width=100% >}}
