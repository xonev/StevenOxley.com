I have the advantage of reading ahead - there's a whole chapter on stability antipatterns - but I think it's interesting that this statement focuses on data issues. I suppose compute-related failures are more obvious and visible: if you accidentally wrote code that contains an infinite loop or is otherwise inefficient it will be more readily caught in testing.
