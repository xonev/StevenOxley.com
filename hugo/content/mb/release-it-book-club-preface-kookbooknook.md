I've been reading the book Release It, and I've started putting discussion questions on [Kook Book Nook](https://www.kookbooknook.com/t/new-book-club-release-it-by-michael-nygard/13). The first few topics to discuss the book are [already up](https://www.kookbooknook.com/t/what-level-of-criticality-are-the-systems-that-you-work-on-preface/15). Come read with me! (Also remember there's a 40% discount to buy the book at https://pragprog.com/ with discount code `stevenoxley`.)
