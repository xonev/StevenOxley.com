I'm not a food blogger. I'm not into baking. But I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease, and I do love bread. So now I've finally found and perfected a recipe for gluten-free bread that I actually enjoy eating, and I can make fairly quickly and easily. And I'll give you all the details you need to make it yourself - even if you have zero experience baking like me.

First of all, buy [this Cuisinart Bread Maker](https://a.co/d/5w67Udx).

Then you're ready for the recipe:

## Dry ingredients
- 3.5 cups | 440g [Namaste Perfect Flour Blend](https://namastefoods.com/products/gluten-free-perfect-flour-blend)
- 0.5 cups | 67.5g corn starch
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp yeast


## Wet ingredients
- 3 large eggs (or 4 not-so-large eggs - better too err on the side of too many than too few)
- 1.5 cups vanilla soy milk
- 1 tbsp cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp oil
- 2 tbsp honey

## Instructions
- Mix dry ingredients except yeast
- Mix wet ingredients (beat with a fork or whisk)
- Warm wet ingredients to 80-90 degrees F
- Put the wet ingredients in the bread maker
- Put the dry ingredients in the bread maker
- Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the yeast
- Set the bread maker to the gluten-free setting, medium crust, 1.5lb loaf, and press start
- During the kneading parts of the cycle use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides and agitate to make sure the dough is being mixed by the paddle

## Details to get it right
Make sure to put enough eggs in. I almost always use four now, though I have had it turn out well with three. We get eggs from a local farm, so they vary in size quite a lot. The variance in size can throw off the result quite a bit when you only put in three eggs.

When measuring the flour and corn starch, this is one of the critical things I learned:  don't use the measuring cup to scoop the flour out of the bag because that will compact it and you'll have too much flour. Instead, if you can't weigh it out, shake the bag, then gently spoon the flour into the measuring cup. When it's full, gently scrape off the top with a knife.

You may have some questions:  can I substitute some other type of milk? Can I use sugar instead of honey? Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend? I don't know. I'm not a baker. Give it a try and let me know what happens.

What I do know is that it's important for the wet ingredients to be warm before they go in the bread maker, so I pop them into my 1200W microwave for 1 minute. They should be in the range of 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Enjoy!
This gluten-free bread is the first we've made that doesn't crumble super easily, tastes good, and isn't too difficult to make. If you try it, I hope you enjoy it!
