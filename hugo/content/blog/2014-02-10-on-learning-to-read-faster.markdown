I am a slow reader. I have known this for a while now. I have even tried to do something about it at one point, but a recent post by my cousin made me realize just how much potential reading speed I'm missing out on. She took the [staples reading test](http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/ereaders/speed-reader/) that has been going around recently and found that she reads at 748 words per minute.

By comparison, I took some tests and found that I read somewhere between 250 and 300 words per minute. And my reading comprehension is not always so good...

I took tests both at the staples website and at [freereadingtest.com](http://www.freereadingtest.com/free-reading-test.html) (I did the Level 9 test). I want to improve my reading speed considerably. I figure that there are two ways to read more: spend more time reading and read faster. I'll start with reading faster, since that allows for reading more no matter the time spent reading.

I plan on posting weekly on my progress and what I've learned and practiced. As a sneak peek for next week, here is a screenshot from a reading test I took when I was reading out loud. Tune in next week for my progress report. Hopefully I will be over 300 words per minute, but I guess we'll see!
