My ham radio license was issued this week! I have a technician class license, and my callsign is KJ7SIL.

Now I need to figure out how to actually make a successful transmission. I have a two-meter handheld radio that I can receive a couple of the local repeaters, but I haven't been able to key one of them up. Which either means that I have something misconfigured with my radio or it just doesn't have enough power to reach the repeaters. Hopefully my dad - who is a very experienced ham - will be able to help me figure it out when he comes to visit.
