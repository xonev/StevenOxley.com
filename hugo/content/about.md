I'm a Senior Principal Software Engineer and aspiring entrepreneur currently located in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  I enjoy programming, snowboarding, spending time with family, playing board games, and riding through the woods at breakneck speeds on my mountain bike.

I send out periodic articles about software engineering - with a focus on platform engineering - from my [mailing list](https://www.stevenoxley.com/mailing-list/). Consider signing up!
