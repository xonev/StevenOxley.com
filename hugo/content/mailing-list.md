I have a mailing list you can join! I write about [platform engineering](https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering) topics - especially focused on getting started with developing a platform at your company or managing a platform without a dedicated platform team.

If that sounds interesting to you, sign up below!

Here are some example articles that were sent to the mailing list:
