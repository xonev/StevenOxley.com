I have finally finished reading _Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters_ by Ryan Singer after many months.

It is a thought-provoking book. It has some good ideas for new approaches to running software projects. It is well written and clear, and I think Singer does a decent job of arguing for the processes and techniques he recommends. I just don't agree with some of his more foundational points and therefore I do not agree with the general thesis of the book.

More on my disagreements later; first, I'd like to point out the pieces from the book that I think are sound.

I think that the general concept of shaping work before working on it is excellent. The high-level idea is that you would make some rough designs and sketch out the flow and functionality of the work you're about to do. This helps flush out any major issues with the design before getting into the details. The [three properties](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02#property-1-its-rough) of shaped work that I agree with are:

1. It's rough: the initial design should be at a high level.
2. It's solved: the solution to the problem has been well thought out. Open questions and rabbit holes have been resolved.
3. It's bounded: the scope - and what is out of scope - is clearly defined.

I find doing this type of design beneficial. It helps point out serious flaws with initial ideas.

- Small batch vs. big batch
- Appetite is just a backwards estimate
