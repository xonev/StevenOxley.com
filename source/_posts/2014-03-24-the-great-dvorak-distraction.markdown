I am pretty fast at typing. I am by no means the fastest ever, but I can hold my own. I don't really worry about how fast I can type; however, I do slightly worry about carpal tunnel. It is for that reason, and that I believe the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard layout is the best keyboard layout _in the world_, that I have allowed myself to be distracted from learning to read faster. Instead, I have been playing around (again) with learning the Dvorak layout.

If you don't know what the Dvorak keyboard layout is, then I strongly suggest you read [this comic](http://www.dvzine.org/zine/index.html) about it. It is very informative and mildly entertaining and by the end of it you may share my opinion of the superiority of Dvorak. Or you may not. But you should still read it. If you don't have time for that, you can always read the gist in the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard). Or, I can just tell you a bit about it. The dvorak layout is basically a keyboard layout that makes sense. Instead of the letters and symbols being more or less random placed as in the common QWERTY layout, the keyboard is laid out keeping two goals in mind:

1. Frequently used keys should be easier to reach with the stronger fingers (e.g. not the pinky).
2. Keys that are frequently pressed sequentually (e.g. consonants are usually followed by a vowel and vice versa) should be pressed by opposite hands.

These two goals make everything much more ergonomic and efficient. You can read one of the links above for more details, or you can just trust me.

Regardless, learning the Dvorak layout is difficult. I have spent a considerable amount of time on it at one point or another, but I have spent almost _20 years_ learning the normal layout... This makes it difficult for me to switch over to Dvorak completely, which is what I would need to do in order to really get good at it. This isn't the first time I've tried. In fact, [the das keyboards](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/) that I normally use (yes, I have two), I bought with alternative keyboard layouts in mind. There are no markings on the keyboard, so I feel like it doesn't matter as much that I keep the QWERTY layout.

Regardless, it is very hard to type at _half speed_ during my everyday tasks. This is how fast I type normally:

And this is how fast I type with Dvorak:

By the way, these screenshots were taken from [typeracer.com](http://play.typeracer.com/), which is _awesome_. If you can imagine with me, typing with Dvorak basically feels like one of those dreams where you are trying to escape bigfoot, but you can't run any faster than slow motion. It's slightly depressing.

It gets worse. Shortcut keys. You have to develop completely new habits of using shortcut keys. _Control-c_ for copying and _control-v_ for pasting are no longer right next to each other. You could remap them, but I would not recommend it. Most shortcut keys start with letters for the thing you want to do (e.g. _c_ for _copy_), so it's not too hard to remember them. It's just hard to develop the new habits.

Furthermore, all of the symbols are in different locations, and, since I don't type most of those very often, they are more difficult to learn. Coding especially is difficult. [Coding is just typing](http://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/), after all. Unfortunately, coding does slow my typing down, and when I'm using Dvorak it's even worse. As evidence, I'll show you some test results from [typing.io](http://typing.io/), which has coding typing tests and is also _awesome_. Here is normal layout:

And this is with Dvorak:

As you can see, slightly depressing. In order to improve the situation, I thought it would be good to find a layout that put the commonly used coding symbols within easy reach. I did find such a layout. It's called [Programmer Dvorak Keyboard Layout](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/). Don't use it. I abandoned it for a couple of reasons. First of all, it rearranges all of the numbers. Why? I'm not sure (I guess the Dvorak layout normally had them arranged that way), but it makes it incredibly confusing because instead of _1, 2, 3_ we now have _7, 5, 3_... Not only that, but it puts the numbers in a shift position! So, to type a _7_, I have to press shift and what used to be the _2_ key. This was the deal breaker for me. All keyboard shortcuts that included a number were unusable for me on my Mac. I literally could not do the shortcut because _command-shift-4_ (for example) is its own shortcut combo.

So, I am still learning the Dvorak layout, but it's hard. I was originally going to write this post using it, but by the time I had done the typing tests, I figured I didn't want to waste the time. It has taken me a while to get up around 40 wpm, but not as long as I thought -- probably a week for the initial learning and then a couple of weeks to improve speed. I plan on continuing to get faster at it here and there, and _hopefully_ I can replace QWERTY completely one day. Because I really do believe in it.
