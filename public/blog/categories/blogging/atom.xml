    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First post!  Aww yeeeeah, I win.  Seriously, though, these are the beginnings of a new blog which I have formed using the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> platform (some of you may have already figured that out from the theme).  You can see the source of any changes I&rsquo;ve made (mostly just creating my own posts/pages) here: <a href="https://github.com/xonev/StevenOxley.com">https://github.com/xonev/StevenOxley.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you would just like to learn more about me, you can go to <a href="/about/">the About page</a>.</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t figured out exactly what I&rsquo;m going to be making this blog about.  Undoubtedly, the majority of the posts will be technical in nature, but I may also throw in the random &ldquo;just-for-fun&rdquo; post now and then.  Hopefully we&rsquo;ll all be enriched by whatever it turns into.</p>
