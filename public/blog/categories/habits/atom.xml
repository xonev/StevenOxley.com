    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is ancient, but let&rsquo;s start a new habit with it. Let&rsquo;s publish something. Every day. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be on the blog, but writing is one of the easier things I can do. I also have a bunch of videos on my harddrive that I could edit and upload to YouTube. I just want to be creating something that I can point to every day.</p>

<p>I am actually a bit surprised that I was able to get the tooling for this blog back up and running after all these years. All it took was installing <code>rbenv</code>, an old version of Ruby &ndash; 1.9.3 &ndash; and an old version of <code>bundler</code> &ndash; 1.0.14 &ndash; and then everything worked. I hope to get a new site up before too long. I&rsquo;ve started working on it <a href="https://github.com/xonev/the-archive/tree/master/websites">here</a>, but as you can see it has stalled. It&rsquo;s hard to find time for things like that with a baby!</p>
