    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 this evening and the first thing I noticed was that my touchpad no longer worked&hellip; Of course, I immediately suspected that &ldquo;touchpad-indicator&rdquo;, the application I installed to disable my touchpad when I have a normal mouse plugged in, was to blame.  However, I decided to do some searching around first and found a couple of forum posts about similar problems.  After reading about their woes, I decided to just try removing touchpad-indicator (<code>sudo apt-get remove touchpad-indicator</code>).  After running that command line and restarting, everything worked fine.  I don&rsquo;t know what changed in the upgrade.  Perhaps it would work again after reinstalling, but I&rsquo;ll probably wait until having the touchpad enabled annoys me again before trying.</p>

<p>I also ran into a problem with the &ldquo;ffi&rdquo; Ruby gem.  As I mentioned in <a href="/blog/2011/09/30/first/">the previous post</a>, I am running this blog on Octopress, which is built on Ruby.  When I would try to run <code>rake generate</code> (&ldquo;generate&rdquo; is the Octopress Rakefile target that builds all of the HTML from the markdown that I write these posts in), I would get something like the following error:</p>

<pre><code>in `require': libffi.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code></pre>


<p>After some investigation, I found that this was easily fixed by running <code>sudo gem pristine ffi</code>.</p>

<p>Other than these two little issues, Ubuntu 11.10 has been pretty good to me so far.  Of course, I&rsquo;ve only used it for an hour or so, but it appears that it hasn&rsquo;t totally hosed my system, so that&rsquo;s a start.  I have noticed that the <code>alt-tab</code> behavior between workspaces is now different.  It will now switch to the next most recently used application no matter what workspace that application is in whereas before it would restrict <code>alt-tab</code> switching to the current workspace.  I&rsquo;ll have to see if I get used to that.  If I don&rsquo;t, I may end up looking around for a setting to change it (I would imagine it would be configurable).  I guess we&rsquo;ll see what other issues I run up against in the following weeks.</p>
