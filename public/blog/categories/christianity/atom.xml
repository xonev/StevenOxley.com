    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I very highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18289396-seeking-allah-finding-jesus"><em>Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus</em></a> by Nabeel Qureshi.</p>

<p>This book has increased my respect for Islam. I am impressed by the discipline Muslims have. For example, every day they pray three times. And not just in private either &ndash; they are very open about it. It can even be a social thing. I wish rituals like this were more common in Christianity to encourage a more consistent prayer life.</p>

<p>This book also increased my faith in Christ. By watching Qureshi go through his journey from devout Muslim to Christian, I really got a sense of how attractively and convincingly Christianity can be presented. Of course, I am quite biased when it comes to being convinced of Christianity, since I myself am a Christian. I think that my bias probably makes Qureshi&rsquo;s story more satisfying.</p>

<p>It may be helpful to put myself in the shoes of someone who does not believe in Christ who might read this book. As an example, I doubt there would be much in this book that would convince an atheist of the existence let alone the power of Christ to change lives. Qureshi clearly believed in God from the outset. At no point did he even question the existence of God. He simply questioned whether the God he had been worshiping was the god of Muhammad or whether he was the father of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>There is one part of the book that I think would be especially unconvincing for someone who questions the existence of the Christian Father God. Qureshi was struggling with some horrible acts of Muhammad that he had learned about &ndash; for example, that Muhammad ordered his men to rape women. The obvious issue with Qureshi&rsquo;s struggle is that the Old Testament states that God called for behavior from the Israelites that was every bit as violent and disturbing.</p>

<p>In another book I&rsquo;ve been reading &ndash; <em>Saying No to God</em> by Matthew Korpman &ndash; Korpman expresses his distress that many Christians try to defend some of the things that God seems to condone in the Old Testament. He brings up the example of Numbers 31 where God commands Moses to &ldquo;Take full vengeance for the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people.&rdquo; This leads to Moses and the Israelites slaughtering the Midianites &ndash; even women and children &ndash; and sparing only the virgins. In fact, the Israelites even spared the women and children before Moses commanded them to &ldquo;kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately.&rdquo; There are a number of different views of texts like these. Korpman&rsquo;s view is that God didn&rsquo;t actually want people slaughtered or virgins forcefully taken as wives. I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the right answer or not, but texts like these certainly place the God of the Old Testament in a similar light to the Muhammad that Qureshi ultimately rejected as a prophet. I would like to know how Qureshi resolved issues like this in his own mind.</p>

<p>All that to say, it was difficult for me to relate to Qureshi&rsquo;s struggle with Muhammad&rsquo;s violence when there are many Christians who have left the faith due to accounts of God&rsquo;s violence. I think violence is something that needs to be addressed when considering either of these Abrahamic religions. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a much bigger topic than I&rsquo;d like to get into in this blog post.</p>

<p>I believe I&rsquo;ve established that this book probably wouldn&rsquo;t be effective at converting someone who didn&rsquo;t already believe in a deity of some description. I think it&rsquo;s telling, though, that Qureshi makes it fairly clear how you could convert someone &ndash; through friendship. Qureshi&rsquo;s friendship with David Wood lead to him being converted. Wood also met an atheist girl and was instrumental in her conversion. So I see that it&rsquo;s through relationship with people that conversion happens. If Wood hadn&rsquo;t become very close friends with Qureshi, there is no way that Qureshi would have listened to anything that Wood had to say.</p>

<p>It is the description of friendship between Qureshi and David Wood in this book that really had an impact on me. It is profound what an effect we can have on other people if we truly care about them. That was my main takeaway from the book &ndash; befriend those around me. Show my care for them and live my life in a way that honors God. That is the most effective way I can witness. I definitely recommend that you read this book.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched a series of videos of an interview with Richard Feynman today.  I highly recommend that you make the time to <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xey45m_the-pleasure-of-finding-things-out_tech">check them out</a>.  (If you don&rsquo;t know who Richard Feynman is, you should <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">look him up</a>.)  While watching the interview, I gained insight into a number of ideas.</p>

<p>One of these is the nature of knowing things.  Feynman shares an anecdote of one interaction with his father.  He asked his father why a ball in a wagon will roll to the back of the wagon when the wagon is pulled forward.  When I heard this question, I immediately thought to myself, &ldquo;Inertia.&rdquo;  But Feynman&rsquo;s father answered, &ldquo;Noone knows&hellip; The accepted belief is that things that are moving tend to stay moving and things that are at rest tend to stay at rest unless something pushes them, but noone knows why that is.&rdquo;  I found that very interesting and enlightening.  There is a difference between knowing the name of something or being able to describe it, and knowing the why and the how of something.  Why do objects at rest tend to stay at rest and objects in motion tend to stay in motion?  Feynman expounds further on what it means to <em>Know</em> something throughout the interview.</p>

<p>I gained the other insight from Feynman&rsquo;s discussion of his beliefs.  He comments on both the ideas he believes in and the certainty with which he believes them.  In fact, he has some very interesting things to say <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taEw97brZis#t=390s">about his beliefs in God and religion in general</a>.  At one point, he says that the view of a scientist is that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s true, everything is possibly wrong.&rdquo;  He then goes on to imply that this is a problem for religion.  I agree with his premise.  I don&rsquo;t think we can know anything with absolute certainty.  I am much more certain of some things than others, but I am not absolutely certain of anything.  All of my beliefs depend on how my mind processes information; how my senses perceive and experience the world.  I can be certain of nothing.</p>

<p>I do not see uncertainty as a problem for religion.  This is how I see it:  once one has accepted that there is no certainty, then there are two fundamental choices:  either adopt faith in something or embrace the reality of not knowing.  In reality, almost everyone chooses the former to one extent or another.  Some choose a faith in the existence of a creator God and His love of mankind while others accept a faith in the absence of such a being, believing only in what they can sense and perceive (for even that is a type of faith, and as with all faith, some have more of it than others).  Richard Feynman chose to accept the reality of not knowing.  He states in the interview that being uncertain about things doesn&rsquo;t scare him.  Neither does it scare me, but yet I choose to have faith in something that cannot be studied by science.</p>

<p>My beliefs are based on my faith in three things.  First of all, that God exists.  Second, that the Bible was inspired by God and, interpreted correctly (ay, there&rsquo;s the rub), is true.  Third, that I can experience reality and reason about it using my mind and body.  Everything else I believe (to greater or lesser degrees of certainty) depends on and sprouts forth from these three things.</p>

<hr />

<p>I find it useful to break things down until they are as clear as I can make them in my mind.  I hope that may be the case for some of you and that this post will encourage you to do the same.  I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>
