    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did not enjoy <em>Prey</em> as much as I thought I would. I think there are a couple of things that I struggled with while reading it.</p>

<p>The first thing I struggled with was actually a problem with the type of topics that Michael Crichton likes to take on. I think of his writing as near-term science fiction. It&rsquo;s definitely science fiction, but it isn&rsquo;t far-fetched science fiction that takes place centuries in the future. It&rsquo;s the type of science fiction that I could imagine happening tomorrow. Usually, I appreciate that, since it explores ways that the world could be different today. However, it can also backfire.</p>

<p>One way that near-term science fiction can fall short is in longevity. If the author is making predictions about how present day technology will evolve then people don&rsquo;t have to wait very long to see whether the other was right. And if the author wasn&rsquo;t right about the evolution then readers may soon lose interest.</p>

<p>I think that missing the mark on predictions of the evolution of technology is where <em>Prey</em> falls short. Without giving too much away, one of the premises of the book is that large swarms of nanobots can evolve to the point where they can have a sort of intelligence and learn new things &ndash; with very minimal programming.</p>

<p>I think at this point the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has shown that this isn&rsquo;t really possible. The algorithms for machine learning that computer scientists have developed to this point show some promise, but not the level of learning the Crichton portrays in <em>Prey</em>. And especially not with swarms of low-resourced agents.</p>

<p><em>Prey</em> was a mildy interesting book, but I don&rsquo;t think I would recommend that anyone read it. It wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t great.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Skunk Works</em> by Ben Rich is a memoir about Rich&rsquo;s time working at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works">Lockheed Skunk Works</a>. The Skunk Works is a small, secretive, advanced research and development organization within Lockheed. Rich relates his experiences from first being tapped by Kelly Johnson &ndash; the founder of Skunk Works &ndash; to design some systems on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2">U-2 spy plane</a> to taking the reins when Johnson retired to his own eventual retirement.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the Skunk Works is what stood out to me in the book. Skunk Works isn&rsquo;t just a secret department within Lockheed. The Skunk Works philosophy emphasizes small, flat, tightly integrated teams that have autonomy to make decisions about their projects. <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/aeronautics/skunkworks/kelly-14-rules.html">Kelly Johnson&rsquo;s 14 rules and practices</a> provides a map for the Skunk Works to operate. Engineers are required to visit the shop floor to interact with those machining the parts and assembling the aircrafts. Outside inspections are kept to a minimum. Unnecessary documentation must be eliminated, but important work must be comprehensively reported.</p>

<p>It is difficult to argue with the results of the Skunk Works' approach. Guided by Johnson&rsquo;s 14 rules and practices, the Skunk Works was able to develop aircraft that were in some cases decades ahead of anything their competitors could design or build. The U-2 spy plane set elevation records that made it untouchable by enemy aircraft or missiles. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird">SR-71 blackbird</a> <em>still</em> holds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_airspeed_record">the airspeed record for a manned airbreathing jet engine aircraft</a>&hellip; which was set 44 years ago in 1976. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk">F-117 Nighthawk</a> was the very first stealth aircraft &ndash; designed not to reflect enemy radar. Only one Nighthawk was ever lost in combat. And they often created these airplanes and others ahead of schedule and under budget.</p>

<p>Ben Rich personally worked on every one of the aforementioned aircraft, so <em>Skunk Works</em> includes many fascinating anecdotes about the technology, politics, missteps, and successes that went into each one. Rich also relates accounts of other Skunk Works projects &ndash; some successful, some not &ndash; as well as personal accounts of his relationship with Kelly Johnson and other aspects of his life.</p>

<p>Some particularly interesting sections of the book are anecdotes provided by people other than Rich. I enjoyed hearing from test pilots, politicians, military brass, and Rich&rsquo;s coworkers. Some of these accounts really helped emphasize the impact that Rich and the Skunk Works have had over the past seven decades.</p>

<p>I think that there is a lot to be learned from the Skunk Works approach to work. It&rsquo;s possible to accomplish a great deal with small, efficient, autonomous teams. I was inspired by this book to pursue a similar approach in my own work, and I was spellbound at points that such great feats of engineering could be accomplished with so little.</p>
